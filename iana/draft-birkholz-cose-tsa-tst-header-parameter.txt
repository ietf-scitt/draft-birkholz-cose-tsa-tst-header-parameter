          COSE Header parameter for RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Tokens
          draft-birkholz-cose-tsa-tst-header-parameter-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a CBOR Signing And Encrypted (COSE) header
   parameter for incorporating RFC 3161-based timestamping into COSE
   message structures (COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1).  This enables the use
   of established RFC 3161 timestamping infrastructure to prove the
   creation time of a message.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3161 [RFC3161] provides a method to timestamp a message digest to
   prove that it was created before a given time.

   This document defines a new CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   [STD96] header parameter that carries the TimestampToken (TST) output
   of RFC 3161, thus allowing existing and widely deployed trust
   infrastructure to be used with COSE structures used for signing
   (COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1).

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Modes of use

   There are two different modes of composing COSE protection and
   timestamping.

2.1.  Timestamp then COSE (TTC)

   Figure 1 shows the case where a datum is first digested and submitted
   to a TSA to be timestamped.

   This mode is utilized when the signature should also be performed
   over the timestamp to provide an immutable timestamp.

   A signed COSE message is then built as follows:

   *  The obtained timestamp token is added to the protected headers,

   *  The original datum becomes the payload of the signed COSE message.

 .---------.              .---------------.     .----------------------.
 | payload +------------->| Sig_structure +---->| COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 |
 '----+----'              '---------------'     '----------------------'
      |                          ^
      |     .---.                |
      |    |     |     .-----.   |
      '--->| TSA +---->| TST +---'
           |     |     '-----'
            '---'

                  Figure 1: Timestamp, then COSE (TTC)

   The message imprint sent to the TSA (Section 2.4 of [RFC3161]) MUST
   be the hash of the payload field of the COSE signed object.

2.2.  COSE then Timestamp (CTT)

   Figure 2 shows the case where the signature(s) field of the signed
   COSE object is digested and submitted to a TSA to be timestamped.
   The obtained timestamp token is then added back as an unprotected
   header into the same COSE object.

   This mode is utilized when a record of the timing of the signature
   operation is desired.

                 .----------------------.         .-----.
                 | COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 |<--------+ TST |
                 '----+-----------------'         '-----'
                      |                              ^
                      v                              |
                 .----------------------.            |
                 | signatures/signature |            |
                 '----+-----------------'            |
                      |                     .---.    |
                      |                    |     |   |
                      '------------------->| TSA +---'
                                           |     |
                                            '---'

                    Figure 2: COSE, then Timestamp (CTT)

   In this context, timestamp tokens are similar to a countersignature
   [RFC9338] made by the TSA.

3.  RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Tokens COSE Header Parameters

   The two modes described in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 use different
   inputs into the timestamping machinery, and consequently create
   different kinds of binding between COSE and TST.  To clearly separate
   their semantics two different COSE header parameters are defined as
   described in the following subsections.

3.1.  3161-ttc

   The 3161-ttc COSE _protected_ header parameter MUST be used for the
   mode described in Section 2.1.

   The 3161-ttc protected header parameter contains a DER-encoded
   RFC3161 TimeStampToken wrapped in a CBOR byte string (Major type 2).

3.2.  3161-ctt

   The 3161-ctt COSE _unprotected_ header parameter MUST be used for the
   mode described in Section 2.2.

   The message imprint sent in the request to the TSA MUST be either:

   *  the hash of the signature field of the COSE_Sign1 message.

   *  the hash of the signatures field of the COSE_Sign message.

   In either case, to minimize dependencies, the hash algorithm SHOULD
   be the same as the algorithm used for signing the COSE message.  This
   may not be possible if the timestamp token has been obtained outside
   the processing context in which the COSE object is assembled.

   The 3161-ctt unprotected header parameter contains a DER-encoded
   RFC3161 TimeStampToken wrapped in a CBOR byte string (Major type 2).

4.  Timestamp Processing

   RFC 3161 timestamp tokens use CMS as signature envelope format.
   [STD70] provides the details about signature verification, and
   [RFC3161] provides the details specific to timestamp token
   validation.  The payload of the signed timestamp token is the TSTInfo
   structure defined in [RFC3161], which contains the message imprint
   that was sent to the TSA.  The hash algorithm is contained in the
   message imprint structure, together with the hash itself.

   As part of the signature verification, the receiver MUST make sure
   that the message imprint in the embedded timestamp token matches
   either the payload or the signature fields, depending on the mode of
   use.

   Appendix B of [RFC3161] provides an example that illustrates how
   timestamp tokens can be used to verify signatures of a timestamped
   message when utilizing X.509 certificates.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations made in [RFC3161] as well as those of
   [RFC9338] apply.

   In the "Timestamp, then COSE" (TTC) sequence of operation, the TSA is
   given an opaque identifier (a cryptographic hash value) for the
   payload.  While this means that the content of the payload is not
   directly revealed, to prevent comparison with known payloads or
   disclosure of identical payloads being used over time, the payload
   would need to be armored, e.g., with a nonce that is shared with the
   recipient of the header parameter but not the TSA.  Such a mechanism
   can be employed inside the ones described in this specification, but
   is out of scope for this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the COSE header parameters defined in
   Table 1 to the "COSE Header Parameters" registry
   [IANA.cose_header-parameters].
